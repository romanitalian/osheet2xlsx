## Troubleshooting

### Linter Issues
```bash
# Local check
make lint

# Auto-fix
make lint-fix

# Check new files
make lint-new
```

### Test Issues
```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Tests with race detector
make test-race

# Tests with coverage
make test-coverage
```

### Build Issues
```bash
# Clean artifacts
make clean

# Rebuild
make build
```

## Branch Protection Setup

It's recommended to configure branch protection rules for the `main` branch:

1. Go to Settings â†’ Branches
2. Add a rule for the `main` branch
3. Enable:
   - Require status checks to pass before merging
   - Require branches to be up to date before merging
   - Require pull request reviews before merging

## Creating a Release

To create a release:

1. Create a tag:
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.0
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

2. GitHub Actions will automatically:
   - Build the application for all platforms
   - Create a release on GitHub
   - Generate release notes
   - Upload artifacts for download
